# üìõ Chaos Engineering: Kubernetes Database Resiliency Experiments

Welcome to the chaos experiment suite designed to test the resilience of the **Sock Shop** microservices demo, specifically focusing on the **MongoDB (catalogue-db)** service in a Kubernetes environment.

This folder contains experiments targeting the database components to validate system behavior under failure scenarios, improve robustness, and enforce graceful degradation.

---

## üî¨ Experiment 1: Catalogue DB Pod Failure

### ‚úÖ Objective

Simulate an abrupt shutdown of the `catalogue-db` pod and observe how the application responds, recovers, and maintains availability.

---

### üß™ Hypothesis

> If the `catalogue-db` pod is abruptly terminated, Kubernetes will automatically restart it, and the Sock Shop application will recover without manual intervention or data loss.

---

### üßæ Experiment Details

#### ‚úÖ Given

- The Sock Shop application is deployed and fully functional.
- The MongoDB `catalogue-db` pod is running in the `sock-shop` namespace.
- All services dependent on the `catalogue-db` are reachable.
- Observability tools like Prometheus and Grafana are configured.
- Alerts or logs are being collected for system behavior tracking.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

| Parameter        | Value                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Target           | `catalogue-db` Deployment (MongoDB) |
| Namespace        | `sock-shop`                   |
| Type             | Infrastructure Attack (Shutdown) |
| Tool             | [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/) |
| Duration         | Immediate (1s delay)          |
| Scope            | 100% of selected targets      |
